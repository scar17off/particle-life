# Particle Life Simulation

This project is an interactive particle simulation that combines elements of artificial life, particle systems, and magical abilities. It creates a dynamic, visually engaging environment where particles of different types interact, evolve, and display various special effects.

## Features

- Multiple particle types with unique behaviors and interactions
- Dynamic attraction and repulsion between particles
- Special abilities for each particle type (e.g., fireball, healing, teleportation)
- Visual effects including glows, trails, lightning, and more
- Interactive elements allowing users to spawn particles and pause the simulation

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. The simulation will start automatically
3. Use number keys (1-9) to spawn different particle types at the mouse position
4. Press the spacebar to pause/resume the simulation

## Customization

Adjust parameters in `js/config.js` to modify particle behavior, counts, and interaction strengths.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and animations

Enjoy exploring the emergent behaviors and patterns in this particle life simulation!
